# ShadowFox Data Science Internship – Advanced Task 1 ✅

## 📌 Task Title: Cricket Fielding Performance Analysis

## 📁 Task Type: Advanced Task – Option 1

---

## ✅ Task Completed

**Task Name:** Cricket Fielding Analysis  
**Description:**  
I performed a detailed fielding performance analysis for **3 players** from a T20 match using IPL sample data.  
The task involved collecting fielding events, categorizing them, and calculating a **Performance Score (PS)** for each player using the formula provided.

---

## 📊 What I Did (Steps Explained Simply):

1. **Selected 3 fielders** from one innings of an IPL T20 match.
2. **Recorded fielding events** like catches, throws, run outs, and drops.
3. **Used a scoring formula** to calculate a Performance Score for each player based on their actions.
4. **Created a table** showing stats for each player like clean picks, catches, runs saved, etc.
5. **Analyzed results** to see which player performed best in the field.

## 📐 Formula Used for Performance Score (PS):

PS = (CP×WCP)+(GT×WGT)+(C×WC)+(DC×WDC)+(ST×WST)+
(RO×WRO)+(MRO×WMRO)+(DH×WDH)+RS


Where:
- CP = Clean Picks  
- GT = Good Throws  
- C = Catches  
- DC = Dropped Catches  
- ST = Stumpings  
- RO = Run Outs  
- MRO = Missed Run Outs  
- DH = Direct Hits  
- RS = Runs Saved or Conceded
